# Reporting Security Vulnerabilities  

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any GitHub-owned repository, please report it to us through coordinated disclosure.  

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues, discussions, or pull requests.**  

Instead, send an email to:  
`jenifar200227@gmail.com`  

## Information to Include  
To help us better understand and resolve the issue, please provide as much of the following information as possible:  

1. **Type of issue**  
   (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, or cross-site scripting)  

2. **Full paths of source file(s)**  
   Related to the manifestation of the issue.  

3. **Location of the affected source code**  
   (tag/branch/commit or direct URL).  

4. **Special configuration**  
   Any configuration required to reproduce the issue.  

5. **Steps to reproduce**  
   Step-by-step instructions for reproducing the issue.  

6. **Proof-of-concept or exploit code**  
   If possible, include a proof-of-concept or exploit code.  

7. **Impact of the issue**  
   Describe how an attacker might exploit the issue and its impact.  


ðŸŒŸ**Note:**  
Even though [open source repositories](https://bounty.github.com/index.html#scope) are outside of the scope of our bug bounty program and therefore not eligible for bounty rewards, we will ensure that your finding gets passed along to the appropriate maintainers for remediation.  


Providing this information will help us triage your report more efficiently.
